        <h1>Franklin Gothic vs. Trade Gothic </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>
			 <p></p>

			 <h3>Franklin Gothic</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Franklin Gothic, first designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1902 for American Type Founders, was named after Benjamin Franklin who was a typesetter himself. In 1980, however, Victor Caruso created a variant known as ITC Franklin Gothic, which has greater variety in weight and is slightly narrower with a larger x-height. There is also an existing “Cyrillic” version, which is significantly narrower than its predecessors. After its rise in popularity, Franklin Gothic is now a classic sans-serif typeface, most popularly seen in Time Magazine, The New York Times, Scrabble, Bank of America’s logo, and Star Wars. Franklin Gothic is most distinguishable by its double-storey a and g, which is rare to find amongst sans-serifs.</p>
             
			 <h3>Trade Gothic</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Trade Gothic, first designed by Jackson Burke in 1948 for Linotype in the US, is commonly referred to as American Gothic. The family has three weights and three widths in total, making for a very versatile typeface. Trade Gothic is most famously seen in Vice, and other popular books, magazines, and newspapers. When put side by side with Franklin Gothic, it is noticeably more condensed, which sharper counters. Overall, these distinctions give Trade Gothic some character which make it notable in a sea of other various sans serif typefaces. In 2008, a variation of Trade Gothic was created called “Trade Gothic Next”, which adds revisions to each character’s terminals and stroke endings.</p>
